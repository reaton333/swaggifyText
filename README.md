# swaggifyText
A simple web application for converting text into a swagified language 

We are live! 
Visit [swagifytext.com](swagifytext.com) to try it out for yourself!

To be frank, this is a dumb web application and should be not be used by anyone.....although if you do choose to use it, fork it, or came here to send a pull request with all of the code deleted then here is some documentation!!

The issue started when I started following Cam Newton on instagram...please see for yourself, and I 1 wanted to decyfer this old language and 2 I wanted to see if I could type like he does for even one sentence. Naturally I gave up and came up with this nifty tool, though between you and me during process of writing and testing this dumb application I learned decyfer this weird language all on my own.....go figure.

#Here is the basic map of characters to be exchanged:
| English Letter | Swaggified Letter | HTML Code  |

| A | Å | &Aring; |
